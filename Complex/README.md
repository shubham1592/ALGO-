# Operations on 2 Complex Numbers in JAVA
A = a + ib, A is a complex number where a = real part and b = imaginary part

## Program performs the following  operations with two complex numbers A, B:

* addition =        A + B or (a+bi) + (c+di)
* subtraction =     A- B or (a+bi) - (c+di)
* multiplication =  A * B or (a+bi) * (c+di)
* division =        A / B or (a+bi) / (c+di)
* mod(A) =          ((a+bi)*(a-bi))^0.5
* mod(B) =          ((c+di)*(c-di))^0.5

## Directions : 
After executing the prgram provide the values of a and b in first line and values of c and d in second line.

## Example
First input will be 1st number with real and imaginary part similarly with second number.

<b>Input:</b> <br>
2 1 <br>
5 6

<b>Output:</b> <br>
7 + 7i <br>
-3 - 5i <br>
4 + 17i <br>
0.26-0.11i <br>
2.24 <br>
7.81 <br>
